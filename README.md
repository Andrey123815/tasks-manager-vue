Creating a note is as follows:

1) The user enters the name of the note and presses one of the buttons - create a note or set a deadline. 

In the first case, the note will be normal, without setting the execution time and special display of the deadline status.

In the second case, the note becomes an event, indicating the countdown time. 
Upon successful completion, the animation of successful completion starts, an hour before the deadline, the note is highlighted in red.

2) The user can also specify the text of the note in detail
